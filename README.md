# debezium_parser
Slim down version of debezium Oracle LogMiner sql parser.

This is a tailored package originated from debezium in order to use LogMiner parser alone with some modification.
I maintained the same package name as its original package so that it can be updated easily if debezium evolves into new versions. 

To build:

$ mvn install

```
